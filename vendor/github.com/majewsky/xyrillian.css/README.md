# xyrillian.css

My personal CSS framework.

This is intended to be imported into other repos either by vendoring the files
into the target repo or by embedding a git submodule. The SCSS files do not
work on their own, but can be imported into the final CSS like in the `examples/`.

To view the examples, run `make && python -m http.server`, then open
<http://localhost:8000/examples/>.
